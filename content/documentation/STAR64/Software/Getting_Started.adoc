== Choosing Your Distribution
There are currently two working distributions of Linux compatible with the Star64, pinix and Armbian. Both distributions use the same kernel[???].The pinix distribution is a custom distribution built by Fishwaldo using Yocto which is an open source project used to create Linux distributions for embedded devices. The pinix distribution is currently focusing on support for GPU and VGPU acceleration for desktop environments. Both distributions use the deb package manager. The Armbian distribution is based on Debian/Ubuntu with changes to make it lightweight and compatible with ARM/RISC-V development boards. 

While there are other RISC-V compatible distributions, none of these have the required device tree entries for the Star64 meaning that none will work fully on the Star64. This includes images for the StarFive2, a sister board which uses the same processor, due to other hardware differences. It may be possible to get other distributions to run on the Star64 by cross compiling the working kernel into another distribution. 

More information about support for features can be accessed [[User:RemDogKap/SandBox/Status of Features | here]].

== pinix
There are currently three prebuilt versions of pinix. one command line only and two desktop environments. Choose one to use for this setup. 

* star64-image-minimal - A command line only image.
* star64-image-weston - A Weston/Wayland "Demo" image.
* star64-image-plasma- A Plasma Based Image.

=== Flashing the Image

==== Linux

First, if not already installed, install `bzip2` and `wget`.

{{< highlight bash >}}
sudo apt update && sudo apt install bzip2 wget
{{< /highlight >}}

Second, download a compressed disk image (`.wic.bz2`) of your chosen verison (minimal, weston, or plasma) from https://pine64.my-ho.st:8443/[here] (source code available https://github.com/Fishwaldo/meta-pine64[here]) using wget. 

{{< highlight bash >}}
wget  https://pine64.my-ho.st:8443/<Name of Image File>
{{< /highlight >}}


.Example
[%collapsible]
====
{{< highlight bash >}}
wget https://pine64.my-ho.st:8443/star64-image-minimal-star64-1.2.wic.bz2
{{< /highlight >}}
====

Where `<Name of Image File>` is the name of your chosen image file. 

Next, decompress the file using bzip2.
{{< highlight bash >}}
bzip2 -d <Path to Image File>
{{< /highlight >}}


.Example
[%collapsible]
====
{{< highlight bash >}}
bzip2 -d star64-image-minimal-star64-1.2.wic.bz2
{{< /highlight >}}
====

Where `<Path to Image File>` is the path to your image file. 

Next, flash the image to the SD card or eMMC module. The open source Balena Etcher with GUI support is recommended but dd will work as well if you are an advanced user. 

==== Windows

First, make sure that you have https://7-zip.org/[7zip] installed and if not, install it. 

Second, download a compressed disk image (`.wic.bz2`) from https://pine64.my-ho.st:8443/[here] (source code available https://github.com/Fishwaldo/meta-pine64[here]) by clicking on the files. 

Third, right click on the downloaded file and select 7-zip. Next click extract. 

Finally, use Balena Etcher to write your disk image to the SD Card or eMMC module . 

=== Booting the Image

First, make sure that the Star64 is powered off, then set the boot dip switches to SD Card or eMMC, whichever applies to you.

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/STAR64_SD_switch_map.png" caption="Dip switch settings to boot from SD Card." class="floatleft" >}}       
{{< figure src="/documentation/images/STAR64_eMMC_switch_map.png" caption="Dip switch settings to boot from eMMC module." class="floatleft" >}}

After that, insert your flash media of choice and connect your peripherals. These can be a keyboard mouse and monitor or a TTL UART cable connected to the GPIO header. Finally, power on the system.

After boot, you should be met with a login screen. The default credentials here for a root user are `root` as a username and `pine64` as a password. The default credentials for a regular user are `pine64` as a username and `pine64` as a password. I
